# servo
Servo control in OCaml for the Raspberry Pi 2 (BCM2836)

This program is written for and tested on the Raspberry Pi 2.
It should also work on the Raspberry Pi after changing the base address of the BCM2835 in the file bcm2835.ml,
but this is untested.

Calling make will compile the files and create the excutable demo,
which needs to be run as root to access /dev/mem to read and write to the Broadcom BCM2835 registers.

The Raspberry Pi 2 has four pins, which can be used to output pwm signals for servos.
Internally the BCM2835 only has two pwm channels, so only two independent pwm signals can be output concurrently.

The two pwm channels can be run at different frequencies simultaniously.

For advanced users: The two pwm channels share a clock divisor.
This divisor can be changed from the user interface on initialization of a servo/pwm pin.
Changing it for one pwm pin will effect the other pwm pin as this divisor is shared between the two channels.
A default value for the clock divisor is set which allows both pwm outputs to be run at frequencies in the range of
less than 50Hz to above 500Hz without changing this default clock divisor.
This should be sufficient for all common servos, including fast 560Âµs heli tail servos, running at 300, 333Hz or higher,
so a change of the common divisor should normally not be necessary.
